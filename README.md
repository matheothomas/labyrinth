# Labyrinth
The goal of this project is to visualise a labyrinth, to learn how to generate one and how to solve it.

## Roadmap
- [x] Make a graphical interface to display the maze.
- [ ] Make a maze generator.
    - [x] Random generator (no guarantee of a solution)
    - [ ] Randomised depth-first search
    - [ ] Randomised Kruskal's algorithm
    - [ ] Randomised Prim's algorithm
- [ ] Make a maze solver.
